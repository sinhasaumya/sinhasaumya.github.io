**I help organizations deliver enhanced value by addressing challenges using data science and analytics.**  

It takes identifying the right opportunities, making good decisions, focusing on issues that matter, listening to customers and refining products and services to successfully achieve goals. I am convinced that data can help us do all of these things; in fact, it can even help us define our goals. The hype around data is not unjustified - there is plenty of evidence of how data has done wonders for businesses.  

By combining my passion for problem-solving with the skills of data science and communication, I want to help organizations emerge as front-runners in an increasingly data and value-driven world. I aim to leverage my 3+ years of experience in analytics-consulting for key players in the fast-paced pharma industry and golden takeaways from my ongoing graduate program in data science to effectively address the pressing challenges our world faces today.
