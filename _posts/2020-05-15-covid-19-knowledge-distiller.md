The COVID-19 pandemic has presented clinicians and researchers with an urgent need for extracting trustworthy and quality information about the virus and its implications to inform diagnostics and therapeutics. It has also demonstrated the volume and velocity with which scientific information can be produced in a short period of time. With several medical journals prioritizing publications related to COVID-19 and increasing usage of pre-print servers to make research findings openly available, the turnaround time for data availability has been quick.

With this backdrop, researchers and clinicians require a reliable model to mine published literature for novel insights, emerging risk factors and therapeutics to inform their work in combating the pandemic. While traditional research models that produce trustworthy and methodologically sound results do exist, the urgency associated with this requirement in the context of a pandemic poses a challenge. As such, we need an innovative text mining and analytical tool that will aid the quick and easy extraction of valuable insights from large datasets of medical literature.

For the purpose of identifying the risk factors of COVID-19, our team comprising clinicians and medical researchers, software engineers and data scientists has taken a credible and informed approach in developing the text-mining model named [COVID-19 Knowledge Distiller] (https://www.kaggle.com/ravikiranbhaskar/covid-knowledge-distiller).

The developed model automates the knowledge discovery process aiding researchers and clinicians in their pursuit of appropriate treatment and management of COVID-19 cases. This process is achieved by identifying whether a given medical article is related to COVID-19 and its relevance to the competition task of identifying clinical risk factors embedded in the literature. The assumption is that supplied databases collectively have relevant information suitable for extraction. While the tool developed was customised to automatically identify COVID-19 related risk factors, it holds the potential for extension to extract useful information from medical literature and build knowledge bases regarding any other medical unit.
