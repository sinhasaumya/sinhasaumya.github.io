COVID-19 has hit the world hard and how. With governments launching applications to trace the spread of the disease, the importance of tracking it from the zip to global level is evident.

The dashboard [COVID-19 Tracker] (https://public.tableau.com/profile/saumya.sinha1550#!/vizhome/COVID-19Tracker_15890027505320/GlobalView) was developed using data collected from Johns Hopkins Open Data. It presents the total number of cases, active cases, deaths and recoveries of differemt countries.  Prior to visualization, the data was cleaned up and processed on R.

Note that the data on the dashboard was last updated in March as the format of the data changed heavily afterwards.
