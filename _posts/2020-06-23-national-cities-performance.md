The Australian population is highly dispersed across its sprawling land area. The highly variant population and population density of different cities raise curiosity about their development and performance from multiple standpoints including but not limited to gross regional product, household income, housing price, environment conditions and wellness.  

The dashboard [Australian National Cities Performance](https://public.tableau.com/profile/saumya.sinha1550#!/vizhome/AustralianNationalCitiesPerformance/AustralianNationalCitiesPerformance-Compare) presents a visualization of the performance of 22 Australian cities. It offers a comparative view to allow users to compare performances of all cities and also a city deep dive view to provide a bird's eye view of each city's overall standing. Hovering over charts presents additional information throughout the dashboard. Visualizations presented on the dashboard are based on [data](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/national-cities-performance-framework) sourced from the Australian government website. As the data was clean, pre-processing was not required.

I was most amazed to find that with a meagre population of ~147,000, Darwin emerges as the top-most contributor of gross regional product. Even with just 3% of the population of the most populous Australian city of Sydney, Darwin has ~41% more gross regional product. Deep diving into the city, I find that while its environmental parameters are better than that of a big city, it fails to offer the perks of convenient public transport which are far superior in its bigger counterparts.
