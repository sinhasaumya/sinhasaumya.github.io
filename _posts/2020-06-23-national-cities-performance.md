---

The Australian population is highly dispersed across its sprawling land area. The highly variant population and population density of different cities raise curiosity about their development and performance from multiple standpoints including but not limited to gross regional product, household income, housing price, environment conditions and wellness.  

The dashboard [Australian National Cities Performance](https://public.tableau.com/profile/saumya.sinha1550#!/vizhome/AustralianNationalCitiesPerformance/AustralianNationalCitiesPerformance-Compare) presents a visualization of the performance of 22 Australian cities. It offers a comparative view to allow users to compare performances of all cities and also a city deep dive view to provide a bird's eye view of each city's social standing. Hovering over charts presents additional information throughout the dashboard.  

Visualizations presented on the dashboard are based on data sourced from the Australian government website.
